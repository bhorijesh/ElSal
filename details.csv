Welcome to the newest land subdivision project in San Blas,in Surfcity1, La Libertad, El Salvador. Here at our development, we offer exclusive lots with breathtaking ocean views and direct access from the main street. Each lot boasts a prime location with stunning sea vistas, ensuring a serene and secure environment for your dream home.

One of the main advantages of our project is that all lots are strategically positioned to overlook the ocean, offering a tranquil setting away from the hustle and bustle. Moreover, the infrastructure is already in place, with the availability of electricity and potable water connections readily accessible to all homeowners. It is worth noting that each new buyer will be responsible for installing their own septic tank for wastewater disposal.

Situated within a minute's drive from the thriving new shopping center, El Encuentro, and just a few minutes away from Sunset Park, our project enjoys convenient proximity to essential amenities. Additionally, the development is approximately a 45-minute drive from the airport and mere minutes away from iconic surf destinations such as Punta Roca, El Tunco, Sunzal, Atami, and El Zonte.
